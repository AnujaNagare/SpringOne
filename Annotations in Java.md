-  Annotations help to associate metadata (information) to the program elements 
  -  i.e. instance variables, constructors, methods, classes, etc.

------------------------------------------

There are 3 categories of Annotation: 
1. Marker Annotations: 
  - purpose is to mark a declaration
  - do not consist any data
  - @Override is an example of Marker Annotation.


2. Single value Annotations: 
  - contain only one member and allow a shorthand form of specifying the value of the member.
    - the name of the member must be value.
  - Example: - @TestAnnotation(“testing”);
