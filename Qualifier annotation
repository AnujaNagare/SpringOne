- By using the @Qualifier annotation, we can eliminate the issue of which bean needs to be injected.

see how we solve the problem by including the @Qualifier annotation to indicate which bean we want to use:

public class FooService {
     
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("fooFormatter")
    private Formatter formatter;
}

By including the @Qualifier annotation, together with the name of the specific implementation we want to use, 
in this example Foo, we can avoid ambiguity when Spring finds multiple beans of the same type.

We need to take into consideration that the qualifier name to be used is the one declared in the @Component annotation.

Note that we could have also used the @Qualifier annotation on the Formatter implementing classes, 
instead of specifying the names in their @Component annotations, to obtain the same effect:

@Component
@Qualifier("fooFormatter")
public class FooFormatter implements Formatter {
    //...
}

@Component
@Qualifier("barFormatter")
public class BarFormatter implements Formatter {
    //...
}
