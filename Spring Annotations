In most typical applications, we have distinct layers like data access, presentation, service, business, etc.

Additionally, in each layer we have various beans. To detect these beans automatically, Spring uses classpath scanning annotations.

Then it registers each bean in the ApplicationContext.

Here's a quick overview of a few of these annotations:

@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
@Service annotates classes at the service layer.
@Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository.
